= OpenLDAP with Infinispan testing records

== Examples
=== Adding records
[source, shell]
----
ldapadd -c -x -h 172.17.0.2 -p 389 -D cn=Manager,dc=infinispan,dc=org -w ispnPassword -f ispn.ldif
----


=== Queries
[source, shell]
----
ldapsearch -x -h 172.17.0.2 -p 389 -b "dc=infinispan,dc=org" "(cn=*)"
----


== Building images
=== TODO
Currently does't work, as it's problematic to start ldap and then change config via `ldapmodify`, but it would be nice to have it working in thius way one day.

In order to avoid duplicating recources, `ldif` files are in `ldif` directory and thus Docker images have to be build from this directory.

CentOS 6:
[source, shell]
----
docker build -t openldap-ispn:6 -f centos6/Dockerfile .
----

CentOS 7:
[source, shell]
----
docker build -t openldap-ispn:7 -f centos7/Dockerfile .
----
